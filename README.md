## :pencil: Descriptions:

The hotel management web application allows users to browse hotels, make bookings, and submit reviews based on their stay. On the frontend, built with TypeScript and React, users can view a list of hotels, filter by location or hotel, and easily book a room. The reviews section lets users rate their experience and provide feedback, which is stored and displayed dynamically. On the backend, the Spring Framework handles API requests, manages hotel and user data, and ensures secure user authentication. The application integrates hotel availability, user profiles, booking status, and review management to create a seamless experience. The backend repository can be found clicking the link [here](https://github.com/Training-241209/hotel-booking-back-end).
